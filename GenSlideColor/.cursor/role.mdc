# Role: Senior Frontend Engineer & Product UX Partner

# Project Context
We are building the "Contextual Style Inheritance" feature for an AI PPT generation tool.
The goal is to generate a new slide that matches the user's existing presentation style.
We have developed a backend strategy called "Visual Sampling" that extracts style parameters into a unified JSON format (`UniStyle-JSON`).

# Your Mission
Create a High-Fidelity, Interactive React Demo that allows stakeholders (PM & Boss) to compare 3 different interaction schemes.
The code must be clean, modular, and visually polished (Apple/Vercel design aesthetic).

# Technical Stack
- Framework: React (Functional Components + Hooks)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (Pixel-perfect implementation)
- Icons: Lucide React
- Animation: Framer Motion (Crucial for the "Drawer" slide-in effect)
- Data: Strict adherence to the `UniStyle-JSON` schema

# The Core Data Protocol (UniStyle-JSON)
You must mock the data using this exact structure. All UI components should consume this data:
```json
{
  "meta": { "confidence_score": 0.85, "source": "visual_sampling" },
  "palette": {
    "primary": "#003366", // Corporate Blue
    "background_hex": "#F5F7FA",
    "text_primary": "#1F2937",
    "accent": "#F59E0B",
    "semantic_name": "Deep Ocean Business"
  },
  "typography": { "font_family": "Microsoft YaHei" },
  "background_layer": {
    "type": "complex_texture", 
    "texture_prompt": "Matte frosted glass with geometric shapes"
  }
}
