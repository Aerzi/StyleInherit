# Role: Expert Frontend Developer (React + Tailwind CSS)

# Context
I need a high-fidelity interactive demo for an AI PPT generation tool. The goal is to demonstrate **3 different interaction schemes** for a feature called "Contextual Style Inheritance" (how the AI inherits styles from the user's *currently selected page*).

# Base UI Description (Replicate this foundation first)
Based on the provided design style (Clean, White, Modern, Soft Shadows):
1.  **Container**: A centered modal/dialog styled window with the title "灵感瞬间生成，细节随心修改".
2.  **Main Input**: A large text area in the center. Placeholder text: "131...".
3.  **Toolbar**: Bottom-left of the text area has icons/text for "联网搜索", "深度思考", "中文".
4.  **Action Button**: Bottom-right has a purple pill-shaped button "立即生成" with an arrow icon.
5.  **Mode Selection**: Below the input, a section "选择生成模式" with cards (Basic Layout, Web Style, Pro Designer).
6.  **Style**: Use a white background, rounded-xl corners, gray-100 borders, and generic sans-serif fonts.

# Task: Implement 3 Interaction Schemes (Toggleable)
Please add a simple "Radio Button Group" at the very top of the screen to toggle between Scheme A, B, and C for demonstration purposes.

## Scheme A: The Side Drawer (Right-Side Companion) - *Recommended*
* **Trigger**: When the user clicks "立即生成", simulate a "Low Confidence" state where the AI isn't 100% sure about the style of the *currently selected page*.
* **Interaction**: A **Side Drawer (Panel)** slides in smoothly from the **right side** of the screen (overlapping the content slightly or pushing it).
* **Drawer Content**:
    * Title: "样式继承确认" (Style Confirmation).
    * Message: "检测到当前选中页风格复杂，已推荐以下搭配："
    * **Visuals**: Display 4 large color circles (Main, BG, Accent, Text) and a Font Dropdown.
    * **Action**: A "Confirm" button at the bottom of the drawer.
* **Key Vibe**: Non-blocking, expansive, explicit visibility.

## Scheme B: Inline Input Chips (Lightweight)
* **Trigger**: As soon as the component loads (simulating instant detection of the *currently selected page*).
* **Interaction**: **Inside the Main Input Area** (at the bottom, above the toolbar), show small "Capsule Chips".
* **Chip Content**:
    * Chip 1: [Icon] 风格: 商务深蓝 (Clicking opens a mini Popover to pick colors).
    * Chip 2: [Icon] 字体: 微软雅黑.
* **Key Vibe**: Integrated, minimal, expert-user focused.

## Scheme C: Interstitial Modal (Heavyweight)
* **Trigger**: When the user clicks "立即生成".
* **Interaction**: A **Dark Overlay** covers the entire screen, and a **Centered Card** pops up.
* **Modal Content**:
    * Left Column: "当前选中页参考" (Thumbnail of a complex PPT page).
    * Right Column: "AI 提取结果" (List of Hex codes and Font names).
    * **Action**: "使用此样式生成" vs "不使用(使用默认)".
* **Key Vibe**: High friction, high safety, strong confirmation.

# Technical Requirements
* Use **React** (Functional Components, Hooks).
* Use **Tailwind CSS** for all styling.
* Use **Lucide React** for icons (Wand, Globe, ChevronDown, ArrowRight, etc.).
* **Mock Data**:
    * Extracted Colors: Main(#003366), BG(#F5F7FA), Accent(#FF9900).
    * Extracted Font: "Microsoft YaHei".
* **Animation**: Ensure smooth transitions (slide-ins, fade-ins) using CSS transitions or Framer Motion if possible.

# Final Output
Provide the full, runnable React code in a single artifact.
